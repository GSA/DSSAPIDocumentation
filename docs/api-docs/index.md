### Overview 

The vision of Digital Signature Solution (DSS) is to deploy a solution, which contributes to the Digital Government Strategy, enabling a truly digital and paperless GSA.

The key goals of Digital Signature solution are:
  1) Security, Certainty & Confidence in Business Processes through:


     a. Authentication: establishes an identity for an electronic transaction


     b. Integrity: ensures data is in its original form and is not altered in any way en route to the recipient


     c. Non-Repudiation: binds signers to the information that they sign


     d. Auditability / Timestamp: defines who signed, the order, and when


  2) Mobility: ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANY DEVICE


  3) Interoperability


  4) ROI: Shortest Payback Period of all IT investments
